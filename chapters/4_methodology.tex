\chapter{Methodology}
\label{chapter:methodology}

This chapter describes your approach to answering your research question. In the case of developing hardware or software, you want to consider the following sections.

\section{Specifications/Requirements}
\label{sec:specifications}

This section describes where the specifications/requirements come from or how they were created. It is standard to list them in a table and give each requirement/specification an identifier to reference it individually.

\section{Architecture/System Design}
\label{sec:design}

This section describes the architecture and system design of the hardware and/or software. You can use IPE, plantUML, or Tikz-UML to create the UML/SysML/... diagrams.
The diagrams in the thesis should be readable and point out the essential parts of the design.

\section{Implementation}
\label{sec:implementation}

This section points out the critical technology choices and limitations.

\section{Tests/Measurements}
\label{sec:measurements}

This section is about testing the implementation against the requirements or measuring important metrics that the software needs to fulfil.
